    "description": "Flat back made out of a light cardboard with a mostly light green front side. The two staplers are packaged on top of one another with a \u00bd stapler overhang. The staplers are laid vertically and take up about \u00bd of the package. The overhang created by placing the stapler on top of one another creates multiple irregular surfaces. Clear plastic is used in packing the staplers."
