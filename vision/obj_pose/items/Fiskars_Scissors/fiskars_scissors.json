    "description": "Blunt-tip Kids Scissors (5 in). Recommended by teachers, trusted by moms and loved by kids! Children love our Blunt-tip Kids Scissors for the handle that’s shiny, bright and smooth, not “sticky” or “bumpy.” Teachers and moms love the safe design and the antimicrobial handle protection. Like all of our Kids Scissors, our Blunt-tip Kids Scissors feature our innovative safety-edge blades for high-quality cutting with a safer blade angle, plus a larger finger loop and an ergonomic thumb loop to provide a natural, more comfortable fit for kids’ fingers. Features: Ideal for kids ages four and up. #1 teacher recommended brand. Innovative safety-edge blades feature a safer blade angle to protect kids while still cutting all classroom materials. Blunt-tip blades provide added safety. Larger finger loop and an ergonomic thumb loop provide a natural, more comfortable fit for kids’ fingers. Smooth, shiny pink handle was specifically requested by kids. Antimicrobial handle protection inhibits the growth of bacterial odors and helps prevent product deterioration.
